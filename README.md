## **Part Two: Adding Posts**

In this part, we’ll add functionality for blog posts using the one-to-many features of SQLAlchemy.

### **Post Model**

Next, add another model, for blog posts (call it ***Post***).

Post should have an:

- ***id***, like for ***User***
- ***title***
- ***content***
- ***created_at*** a date+time that should automatically default to the when the post is created
- a foreign key to the ***User*** table

### **User Interface**

Here is what you should build:

1. **Better User Detail**

1. **New Post Form**

1. **Post Detail Page**

1. **Post Edit Page**

### ****Add Post Routes****

**GET */users/[user-id]/posts/new :*** Show form to add a post for that user.

**POST */users/[user-id]/posts/new :*** Handle add form; add post and redirect to the user detail page.

**GET */posts/[post-id] :*** Show a post. Show buttons to edit and delete the post.

**GET */posts/[post-id]/edit :*** Show form to edit a post, and to cancel (back to user page).

**POST */posts/[post-id]/edit :*** Handle editing of a post. Redirect back to the post view.

**POST */posts/[post-id]/delete :*** Delete the post.

### **Change the User Page**

Change the user page to show the posts for that user.

### **Testing**

Update any broken tests and add more testing

### **Celebrate!**

Yay! Congratulations on the first big two parts.

## **Parts Two Further Study**

There are several possible additional tasks here.

### **Make a Homepage**

Change the homepage to a page that shows the 5 most recent posts.

### **Show Friendly Date**

When listing the posts (on the post index page, the homepage, and the user detail page), show a friendly-looking version of the date, like “May 1, 2015, 10:30 AM”.

### **Using Flash Messages for Notifications**

Use the Flask “flash message” feature to notify about form errors/successful submissions.

### **Add a Custom “404 Error Page”**

Research how to make a custom page that appears when a 404 error happens in Flask. Make such a page.

### **Cascade Deletion of User**

If you try to delete a user that has posts, you’ll get an ***IntegrityError*** — PostgreSQL raises an error because that would leave posts without a valid ***user_id***.

When a user is deleted, the related posts should be deleted, too.
